## 2. URL Shortener
A simple URL shortening service built with **Express.js**.

**Description**:
Currently, using Express, a user can send an original link (redirect URL), and the server returns a shortened URL using the `nanoid` package. The service performs the following operations:
- Accepts a long URL from the user.
- Generates a unique shortened URL based on the original URL using `nanoid` (a small, secure, URL-friendly unique string generator).
- The shortened URL can be shared, and when clicked, it redirects to the original link.

This URL shortener provides:
- A clean and compact version of long URLs.
- Efficient URL redirection for users.
