# URL Shortener To-Do List

### 1. Create Front-End Component for URL Submission and Display

**Goal**: Allow users to submit a URL and receive a shortened version of it.

#### Tasks:

- Design a simple form where users can input the URL they want to shorten.
- Display the shortened URL after submission.
- Ensure the front-end communicates with the back-end to generate and retrieve the shortened URL.

### 2. Ensure Unique Shortened URL for Each Redirect URL

**Goal**: Optimize storage by generating a shortened URL only for unique redirect URLs.

#### Tasks:

- Modify the back-end logic to check if a redirect URL already exists in the database.
- If the redirect URL exists, reuse the existing shortened URL (instead of generating a new one).
- Ensure that only unique URLs are stored to reduce duplication and save storage space.
- Update the database schema, if needed, to handle URL uniqueness.

### 3. Implement User Authentication

**Goal**: Add user authentication so that users can securely access and manage their URLs.

#### Tasks:

- Set up user registration and login (using JWT, OAuth, or another authentication method).
- Create authentication routes (sign-up, login, and logout).
- Protect routes related to URL creation, viewing, and analytics so they are accessible only by authenticated users.

### 4. Allow Users to View Their Generated Links and Analytics

**Goal**: Provide users with an interface to see all the URLs theyâ€™ve shortened, along with analytics.

#### Tasks:

- Create a dashboard where users can view all the links they have generated.
- Display for each shortened URL:
  - The original URL (`redirectURL`)
  - The shortened URL
  - Click analytics (e.g., how many times the shortened URL has been accessed).
- Integrate the tracking of click analytics (e.g., count the number of visits to each shortened URL).
